Exercises


1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Programers use pseudocode to help develop algorithms. The pseudocode describes what code should do in an easy to read syntax.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Pseudocode is not a code and while humans can read it will not run on a computer. 

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number > second number THEN
	PRINT first number + "is greater"
ELSE 
	PRINT second number + "is greater"
ENDIF




2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.


INIT 0
INPUT a number
WHILE the number is 1 to 100
	PRINT a number
ENDWHILE



3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT an entry 
IF entry = entry in a phonebook THEN
	PRINT phonebook entry
	ELSE PRINT entry does not exist
ENDIF



4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

1)
function greaterNumber( num1, num2) {
  if (num1 > num2){
    return(num1 + " is greater!");
  }
   else {
      return(num2 + " is greater!");
   }
}

greaterNumber( 3, 1 );


2)
function countToHundred(){
  for ( let i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    console.log(i);
  } 
}
countToHundred();


3)
// const phonebook = [ "dog", "cat", "horse", "bird"];

function entryMatch(item){

  let isFound = false;
  phonebook.map(function(entry){
    console.log(entry);
    if (item === entry) {
       isFound = true;
    }
  })
  return isFound;
}

console.log(entryMatch("cat"));
